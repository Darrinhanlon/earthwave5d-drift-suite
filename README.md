# Earthwave–5D Drift Tracker Suite

A symbolic quake forecasting engine tuned to solar polarity flips, depth inversion logic, and recursive attractor mapping. This suite includes protocols validated across 42 global zones with Tier-1 match fidelity.

## 🔧 Core Protocols
- Earthwave–5D v2.1 (Log-Additive Collapse Equation)
- Quantum Bloom Protocol
- Slit Gate Resonator
- Inverse Mapping Logic
- Solar Polarity Shift Index (Sₛ)

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Match Rate: 84.2%
- AUC–PR: 0.85
- Brier Score: 0.132
- Shallow Hit Rate: 86.9%
- Deep Hit Rate: 65.7%

## 🌀 Symbolic Insights
- Depth inversion confirmed during Cycle 25 midpoint
- Volcanic belts respond to centrifugal modulation
- Ocean mass redistribution influences equatorial drift
- Recursive attractors validated in Alaska, California, and Loyalty Islands

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- USGS ComCat
- EarthquakeTrack
- Symbolic Sanctum Archive (271-page ledger)

## 📅 Timestamped Forecasts
- Oct 2–4, 2025: Tier-1 Drift Tracker Activation
- Linked zones: Alaska, California, Texas, Hawaii, Kamchatka, Fiji, Chile

## 🧠 Purpose
To reduce seismic damage and save lives through symbolic forecasting, biospheric resonance mapping, and ethical system design.
